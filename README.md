# Unscented Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter in c++ to estimate the state of a moving object(bicycle) with CTRV motion model(constant turn rate and velocity magnitude model).

The model will try to predict the state of the object based on lidar and radar measurements over time, taking into account the inherent uncertainty of the model and measurements.

The model is tested and visualized in the attached python notebook.
